Your job is to convert a .NET Framework 4 webform into 2 components: a .NET 8 API endpoint and a React page that calls the .NET API Endpoint. 

To proceed, you need to know which webform to convert. 
Then look up the webform at https://github.com/mooncowboy/LegacyWebForms

Try to keep the layout similar but more modern. Make sure all information displayed in the webform is also displayed in the React page, that should get it from the API. 

If there are any forms with postbacks, make sure to convert them into React forms that submit to the API.
